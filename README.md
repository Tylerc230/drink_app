## Pour Square

###What it does
Pour Square is an iOS app that allows users to 'check in' with certain adult 
beverages they've consumed over the course of their night. The user is given 
rewards based on the type of drink the user has been drinking. For instance
if the user has 3 or more mimosas before 1pm they would be awarded the 
'Bottomless mimosa' award. Users are able to view their friends rewards and
also send a 'cheers' to any of their friends.

###How it works
Pour Square consists of an iOS client and a Ruby on Rails backend. It 
utilizes the Facebook friend graphic for its social aspect. It also has a 
administration page where admins can add new awards or drink types.
